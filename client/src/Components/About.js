        Hi, I'm Matt! I'm an aspiring coder who loves trying new things and learning by doing . Right now I'm mostly spending my time either coding or hanging out with my girlfriend and dog. I have lots of hobbies I dabble in so check out the hobbies page if you want to know more about that.<br></br><br></br>

        I grew up in Ticonderoga, NY and spent my summers running around with friends, biking and boating on Lake George. Winters were spent skiing or snowboarding, depending on the year. I played sports throughout the year and video games were a staple of my day. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        After going to college for finance and working in that field for a few years I decided it just wasn't for me. I spent some time going back to work for my dad's construction company (which definitely wasn't for me, sorry dad) I landed at Burlington Code Academy. Having always played video games, being an internet kid and building my own PC I decided learning what's behind these things was of pretty great interest to me. I've always had an interest in how things work, even stuff I didn't really use or care for, so diving into the inner workings of my interests and making it a career seemed like a good step.
