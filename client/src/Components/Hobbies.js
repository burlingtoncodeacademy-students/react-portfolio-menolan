            When I'm not at my computer coding you can most likely find me at my computer playing video games, watching basketball or editing photos. All jokes aside I do get outside quite a bit thanks to my dog, Phife. My girlfriend and I go all over with him and he's become my full time hobby for now (no complaints).<br></br><br></br>
